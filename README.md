# Investigating the Impact of Movement on Visual Perception in Humans through Visual Illusions

Welcome to the official repository for our research project on understanding how movement affects visual perception through the use of visual illusions. This project is conducted by graduate students, Siyuan Peng and Zongxia Li, from the Computer Science Department at University of Maryland, College Park.

## About the Project

This research aims to delve into the complex dynamics of visual perception, particularly focusing on how movement influences our interpretation of visual illusions. The outcomes of this study have the potential to contribute significantly to advancements in cognitive science, user interface design, and therapeutic methodologies.

### Objectives

- To analyze the effects of movement on visual perception.
- To understand the role of visual illusions in perceiving motion.
- To contribute to the development of more intuitive user interfaces and effective therapeutic strategies.
