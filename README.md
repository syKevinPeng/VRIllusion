# Investigating the Impact of Movement on Visual Perception in Humans through Visual Illusions

Welcome to the official repository for our research project on understanding how movement affects visual perception through the use of visual illusions. This project is conducted by graduate students, Siyuan Peng and Zongxia Li, from the Computer Science Department at University of Maryland, College Park.

## About the Project

This study aims to explore the interplay between movement and visual motion perception in humans, inspired by recent findings in rodent studies that suggest a significant enhancement in visual neural signals related to motion during physical activity. We propose a visual psychophysics study. Specifically, through visual illusions, we propose to investigate whether movement can induce stronger neural signaling in humans, thus affecting their perception of visual illusions.

### Objectives

- To analyze the effects of movement on visual perception.
- To understand the role of visual illusions in perceiving motion.

## Participation

We are currently recruiting participants for our study! If you are interested in participating or know someone who might be, please visit [Here](./RecruitmentLetter.pdf). Your participation is vital to the success of our research and contributes valuable insights into the field of visual perception.

### Eligibility Criteria

- Must be at least 18 years old.
- No history of severe visual impairment (corrective lenses and contacts are fine).
- Willing to participate in a study session lasting between 30-60 minutes.

### How to Participate

1. Read the [Participant Information Sheet](link-to-information-sheet) carefully.
2. Sign the [Consent Form](link-to-consent-form) if you agree to participate.
3. Follow the instructions to schedule your session [link-to-scheduling].
